# convnet-on-mnist-dataset
My first neural network using PyTorch. It is a Convolutional Neural Network that gives 98% accuracy on MNIST dataset.
Most of it is code from https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py modified to suit torchvision.datasets.MNIST.
